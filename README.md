# MSBD5001

The programme is written in Python

The required packages include numpy, pandas, sklearn, datetime, xgboost

The description of the code are as follows:

Firstly, the code will drop the outlier from the dataset

Secondly, the code will then create new features including holiday and weather information for the training data which are then used to train the model. 

After that, the code create new features for the testing data which is similar to training data. 

FInally, the code implement the trained model to the testing data and thus output the file.

The procedure of running the file:

1) Run the first bloc to import the package
2) Run the second bloc to drop the outlier and train the model
3) Run the third bloc to implement the model on the testing data
4) Run the last bloc to output the file
